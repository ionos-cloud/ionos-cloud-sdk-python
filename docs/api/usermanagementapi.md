## **um\_users\_s3ssourl\_get**

> S3ObjectStorageSSO um\_users\_s3ssourl\_get\(user\_id, pretty=pretty, x\_contract\_number=x\_contract\_number\)

Retrieve S3 object storage single signon URL for the given user

You can retrieve S3 object storage single signon URL for the given user. This user Id can be found in the response body when a user is created or when you GET a list of users.

### Example

* Basic Authentication \(Basic Authentication\):

  ```python
  from __future__ import print_function
  import time
  import ionoscloud
  from ionoscloud.rest import ApiException
  from pprint import pprint
  # Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5
  # See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
  configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = 'https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5',
  )
  # The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
  # in accordance with the API server security policy.
  # Examples with auth method are provided below
  # Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
  configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
  configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
  # Enter a context with an instance of the API client
  with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.UserManagementApi(api_client)
    user_id = 'user_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the user
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to True)
    x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)
    try:
        # Retrieve S3 object storage single signon URL for the given user
        api_response = api_instance.um_users_s3ssourl_get(user_id, pretty=pretty, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

    try:
        # Retrieve S3 object storage single signon URL for the given user
        api_response = api_instance.um_users_s3ssourl_get(user_id, pretty=pretty, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print('Exception when calling UserManagementApi.um_users_s3ssourl_get: %s\n' % e)
  ```
