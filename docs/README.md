![CI](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/sdk-resources/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![PyPI version](http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ionoscloud)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ionoscloud/) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ionos-cloud/sdk-general.png)](https://gitter.im/ionos-cloud/sdk-general)

## Overview

The IONOS Cloud SDK for Python provides you with access to the IONOS Cloud API. The client library supports both simple and complex requests. It is designed for developers who are building applications in Python. The SDK for Python wraps the IONOS Cloud API. All API operations are performed over SSL and authenticated using your IONOS Cloud portal credentials. The API can be accessed within an instance running in IONOS Cloud or directly over the Internet from any application that can send an HTTPS request and receive an HTTPS response.

## Getting Started

An IONOS account is required for access to the Cloud API; credentials from your registration are used to authenticate against the IONOS Cloud API.

### Installation & Usage

### pip install

Since this package is hosted on PyPI \([https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/)\) you can install it like this

```bash
pip install ionoscloud
```

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ionos-cloud/sdk-python.git
```

\(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/ionos-cloud/sdk-python.git`\)

Then import the package:

```python
import ionoscloud
```

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```bash
python setup.py install --user
```

\(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users\)

Then import the package:

```python
import ionoscloud
```

### After installing please run the following code:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ionoscloud
from ionoscloud.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples with auth method are provided below

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    username = 'YOUR_USERNAME',
    password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.Api(api_client)
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to True)
    depth = 0 # int | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
    x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)

    try:
        # Display API information
        api_response = api_instance.api_info_get(pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling Api->api_info_get: %s\n" % e)
```

## Feature Reference

The IONOS Cloud SDK for Python aims to offer access to all resources in the IONOS Cloud API and also offers some additional features that make the integration easier:

* authentication for API calls
* handling of asynchronous requests 

## FAQ

1. How can I open a bug/feature request? 

Bugs & feature requests can be open on the repository issues: [https://github.com/ionos-cloud/sdk-python/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/sdk-python/issues/new/choose)

1. Can I contribute to the Python SDK?

Pure SDKs are automatically generated using OpenAPI Generator and don’t support manual changes. If you need changes please open an issue and we’ll try to take care of it.
